### Hi Guys, I'm Jean 👋

<h4> I'm an Information Security Researcher/Pentester </h4>

- I am a Software Security Analyst with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and currently pursuing a master's degree in the same field. I am actively engaged in the application security team at one of Brazil's largest software companies. In this role, I am responsible for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in major e-commerce platforms used by national and international corporations, particularly those employing VTEX technology. My prior experience includes working in the offensive security team at one of Brazil's leading institutes for science, research, and technology, specializing in security testing for Samsung software. During my undergraduate studies, I actively contributed to university research projects. My expertise spans red teaming, web/API, mobile, and IoT security, as well as a strong foundation in computer forensics and related fields.
